"A large study of more than 11,000 little kids (ages 3 to 7)","having a regular bedtime, independent of the time of that bedtime, was linked with better reading, math, and spatial capabilities. Children with irregular bedtimes also had more behavioral issues, such as moodiness and hyperactivity, and kids with late and irregular bedtimes were the most affected.",Maintain a regular bedtime for children to improve cognitive abilities and reduce behavioral issues.
Recent studies,"During sleep our brains clean themselves up, removing unhelpful by-products of the day’s neural activity.",Helping children develop good sleep hygiene is one of the most important contributions parents can make to their well-being.
National Sleep Foundation poll on children’s sleep,infants and toddlers who were put to bed asleep tended to sleep about an hour less at night than those who were put to bed awake. Those who were put to bed asleep were nearly three times as likely to wake two or more times compared to those who are put to bed awake.,It is recommended to put your child to bed awake in order to promote better sleep and self-soothing skills.
research on this topic,structured sleep plans work and increase well-being for the whole family,"We recommend checking on your child every 5 minutes so that her tears are ones of protest, not worry, fear, or abandonment."
