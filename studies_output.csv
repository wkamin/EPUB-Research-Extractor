"large study of more than 11,000 little kids","having a regular bedtime, independent of the time of that bedtime, was linked with better reading, math, and spatial capabilities. Children with irregular bedtimes also had more behavioral issues, such as moodiness and hyperactivity, and kids with late and irregular bedtimes were the most affected.",Maintain a regular bedtime for children to improve academic performance and behavior.
National Sleep Foundation poll,Half of infants and a third of toddlers get less sleep than their parents think they need.,Parents should ensure their children are getting the recommended 11 to 12 hours of sleep per night.
American Academy of Pediatrics,Children ages 6 to 10 drink caffeinated beverages eight out of ten days.,Parents should limit their children's consumption of caffeinated drinks to promote better sleep.
One well-known experiment,"found that restricting or extending sleep by 30 minutes had a significant impact on reaction time, attention, and memory in school-age kids. A 1-hour difference between groups was equivalent to two years of academic level.",Ensure children get adequate sleep to support their learning and academic success.
Many studies,"have shown that even a modest decrease in sleep can lead to decreased activity in the brain's prefrontal cortex, impacting executive function.","Prioritize sleep to support children's executive function, impulse control, and creativity."
Study on the effects of short sleep duration on vocabulary and nonverbal intellectual skills in children aged 2½ to 6 years,"Short sleep (fewer than 10 hours per night) in children aged 2½ to 6 years is linked to lower vocabulary and nonverbal intellectual skills, even if they later catch up in sleep duration.",Ensure children aged 2½ to 6 years get at least 10 hours of sleep per night to support vocabulary and nonverbal intellectual skills development.
Study on the connection between sleep and ADHD in children,"Children with sleep issues have a higher prevalence of hyperactivity and attention problems, and vice versa. Treating sleep problems may help eliminate hyperactivity and attention issues in some children.","Addressing sleep problems in children, including those without diagnosed attention or behavior problems, may help improve hyperactivity and attention."
Study on the link between insufficient sleep and weight gain in children and adults,"Too little sleep is linked to weight gain in both kids and adults, with children who have short sleep durations at higher risk for obesity in adulthood.","Ensure both children and adults get sufficient sleep to help regulate appetite, metabolism, and reduce the risk of obesity."

Those who were put to bed asleep were nearly three times as likely to wake two,It is recommended to put babies and toddlers to bed awake to improve self-soothing skills and reduce nighttime waking.
Nighttime sleep-wake patterns and self-soothing from birth to one year of age: a longitudinal intervention study,"The study found that self-soothing behaviors developed gradually over the first year of life, with infants showing more self-soothing behaviors at night as they got older.",Parents can encourage self-soothing behaviors in infants by allowing them to fall asleep on their own and providing a consistent bedtime routine.
Factors associated with fragmented sleep at night across early childhood,"The study identified several factors associated with fragmented sleep in early childhood, including parental presence at bedtime, nighttime awakenings, and environmental factors.","Parents can promote better sleep in young children by establishing a consistent bedtime routine, creating a sleep-friendly environment, and addressing any underlying sleep disturbances."
